# Smart-Tiredness-Monitoring
Fatigue detection is an essential research area with the aim of improving safety, particularly in driving a car and operating heavy equipment. This work introduces a facial recognition-based fatigue detection system for eye and mouth movement analysis in relation to alertness levels of a person. Based on the face recognition library, the system identifies facial features and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for closed-eye and yawning detection. The execution processes video streams and static images in real-time to calculate tiredness. The system continuously examines facial features, recalculation of a score based on tiredness indicators. In case the score crosses a predetermined threshold, it alerts to signal likely tiredness. By providing visual feedback through an overlay on the video stream, the user interface increases awareness. This project illustrates the application of machine learning and computer vision in monitoring human behaviour, supplementing safety measures in environments where fatigue can lead to accidents. The findings highlight the value of proactive monitoring systems in reducing risk from fatigue-induced impairments.
